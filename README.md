# hangman-command-line

To use this app you must run node.
Make sure you install the correct npm packages from the package.json file.

From the command line type:

    node game.js
    
    
You will be prompted to guess letters for the hidden word.

Be careful you 5 wrong letters and the game is over.

If you have no idea about node or npm packages, please try my other hangman game:
